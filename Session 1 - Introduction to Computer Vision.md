4. **Segmentation**: Dividing an image into segments or regions to isolate specific objects or areas, such as segmenting a person from the background.
5. **Facial Recognition**: Identifying or verifying individuals based on their facial features.
6. **Optical Character Recognition (OCR)**: Converting text within images into machine-readable text.
7. **3D Vision**: Understanding the three-dimensional structure of objects or scenes from 2D images, often used in robotics and autonomous vehicles.
8. **Motion Analysis**: Tracking and analyzing movement within a video sequence, such as human motion analysis in sports.

### Applications:
