1. Visualisation of Convolutions demo in detail. - titos:/bolocut.eltute lo/to-explaineu
2. How to enable GPU resources on Google Colab.
3. Learn to create basic convolution architecutre with all the details.
4. Calculate the paramaters of the architecture.
5. Training and testing (inference)
6. Accuracy Metrics.
7. Advance topics like early stopping, batch normalisation, dropouts, checkpoints, callbacks.
